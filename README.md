# interstate-addiction-data

Hello! Our names are Sophia Roch√© and Cecily Stern. We focused our BIO 185 project on the growing drug and opioid epidemic in the United States. We looked to analyze several topics regarding addiction:
  1. The prevalence of addiction to different categories of drugs. As access to, and the decriminalization of, several prescription and recreational drugs has increased in recent years, so have addiction rates.
  We compared the prevalence of drug use among major U.S. cities, as well as trends in drug use within each state.
  2. Death rates and subsequent reporting rates. An increase in drug-related deaths does not necessarily correspond to those states reporting full or complete statistics. Several states have reporting quality
  below 100%, with some dipping much lower, so we looked at the death rates of each state compared to their reporting quality. A state with low reporting quality may actually have more deaths than the
  reported/known number, thus highlighting the need to further investigate drug addiction and overdose within the U.S.
  3. Virginia in particular. As natives of Virginia, we wanted to understand drug addiction within our own state. How many overdose deaths does Virginia see each year? Are these numbers increasing, and why?
  We used overdose data alongside Virginian median income data to understand the proposed relationship between lower income/poverty and increased drug addiction.
  
Our hope is to help educate people about this growing problem of addiction within the United States, and within our home state, so that we can prevent further addiction trends in the future.
